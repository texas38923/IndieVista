      <h1>Our History</h1>
      <p>
        In the year 2022, a group of passionate travel enthusiasts came together
        with a shared dream - to unveil the hidden wonders of India to the
        world. United by their love for diverse cultures, breathtaking
        landscapes, and the spirit of adventure, they founded "IndieVista" - a
        gateway to the enchanting tapestry of India's tourism. <br></br>
        <br></br>The founders envisioned IndieVista as a bridge between curious
        globetrotters and the rich tapestry of India's heritage, history, and
        natural beauty. Fueled by a desire to shatter stereotypes and showcase
        the true essence of this incredible nation, IndieVista was born.
